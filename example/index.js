/**
 ** ================ Endpoints ===================
 */

// An Endpoint resolves the specified URI.

/* ================ without param =================== */

// Endpoints without parameters have the highest specificity, so they get matched first

// these are the most specific, as they only resolve a specific URI, requested via a specific method (also supports head, connect and trace)
app.get('/get', (_req, res, _params) => {
  buildRes(res, 'get');
});

  buildRes(res, 'patch');
});

  serveFromFS(res, './html/home.html');
});

/* ================ with parameters =================== */

//params are prefixed with ':' and can be registered with all above mentioned functions
// endpoints with parameters are less specific than endpoints without
// for more info on the Params class look at the types-section

// going to '/echo-route-params/first-param/second-param' will return 'first-param second-param'

});

/* ================ with wildcard =================== */

// by having '/:*' as the last part of the URI the endpoint will resolve all requests that start with the URI
// params will include the rest of the requested URI in route
// params.route('*') will return an array of strings (the rest split on every '/')

// going to '/wildcard/a/b/c' will return '3 (a-b-c)'
// going to '/wildcard' will return '0 ()'

 ** ================ Types ===================
 */

/**
 ** MIME
 * MIME is an Object that provides nice auto completion for the most commonly used mime types.
 * Instead of writing them out every time you can just use STD_MIME and auto completion.
 * This aim is to:
 *  - decreases the amount of magic strings in your code
 *  - avoid errors tue to miss typing
 *  - spend less time repetitively typing the same few strings over and over
 */

 * functions that expect a HTTP method use this type
